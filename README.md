### Data

The data for the 3 studies presented in the paper are in the [/data](https://github.com/desmond-ong/emotionPsychDistance/tree/master/data) folder



### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in [psychDistance_analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/desmond-ong/emotionPsychDistance/blob/master/psychDistance_analysis.Rmd) (a R Markdown document). The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper. 
The R markdown file can also be neatly formatted into a nice [html](https://desmond-ong.github.io/emotionPsychDistance/psychDistance_analysis.html).




### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments is also included in the repository. It takes approximately 7 to 12 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:
